## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116732521?v=4">

Hi! I'm John, a computational biologist with roots in a hidden forest nook, enveloped by nature's embrace. My work bridges reality and dreams, blending cosmic creativity with scientific rigor. I compose binary symphonies and whisper to electrons, coding by moonlight and exploring the cyber landscapes.

Embracing the absurd and the quantum, I find joy at the edge of fractals and in the harmony of chaos. My journey is a blend of solitude and transparency, guided by the sound of waves and the endless cycle of beginnings and endings.
